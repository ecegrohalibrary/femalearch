<p>Neri Oxman (Hebrew: נרי אוקסמן‎; born February 6, 1976) is an American–Israeli designer and professor at the MIT Media Lab, where she leads the Mediated Matter research group. She is known for art and architecture that combine design, biology, computing, and materials engineering.

    Her work embodies environmental design and digital morphogenesis, with shapes and properties that are determined by their context. She coined the phrase "material ecology" to define her work, placing materials in context.[3][4] Stylistic trademarks include brightly colored and textured surfaces with structure at many scales, and composite materials whose hardness, color, and shape vary over an object. The results are often designed to be worn or touched, and inspired by nature and biology.
    
    Many of Oxman's projects use 3D printing and fabrication techniques. They include the Silk Pavilion, spun by silkworms released onto a nylon frame,[5] Ocean Pavilion, a water-based fabrication platform that built structures out of chitosan,[6] Glass I,[7] the first 3D printer for optically transparent glass and a set of glasswork produced by it,[8] and collections of 3D-printed clothing and wearables worn in couture shows and performances.[9]
    
    She has held exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and Boston's Museum of Science, which have some of her works in their permanent collections, including SFMOMA.[10] MoMA curator Paola Antonelli called her "a person ahead of her time, not of her time",[11] and Bruce Sterling called her work "shatteringly different from anything before".[12]</p>
