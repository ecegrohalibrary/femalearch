<p>Eileen Gray (born Kathleen Eileen Moray Smith; 9 August 1878 â€“ 31 October 1976) was an Anglo-Irish architect and furniture designer and a pioneer of the Modern Movement in architecture. Over her career, she was associated with many notable European artists of her era, including Kathleen Scott, Adrienne Gorska, Le Corbusier, and Jean Badovici, with whom she was romantically involved.
